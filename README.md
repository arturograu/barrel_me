# Barrel Me 🛢️

A Visual Studio Code extension for Dart and Flutter projects that makes creating barrel files effortless.

## Features

✨ **Easy Barrel File Generation**: Right-click on any folder to create a barrel file with all Dart exports.

🏗️ **Hierarchical Barrel Generation**: Optionally create barrel files in each subfolder, with the parent exporting subfolder barrels for better organization.

🎨 **Intuitive UX**: Inspired by the Flutter Bloc extension, providing a familiar and smooth experience.

⚙️ **Customizable**: Configure which folders and files to exclude from barrel generation.

🔄 **Smart Detection**: Automatically excludes existing barrel files and main.dart.

🚀 **Quick Creation**: Press Enter without typing to automatically use the folder name as the barrel name.

🛡️ **Conflict Prevention**: Detects files with the same name as folders and creates `{name}_barrel.dart` instead of overwriting your code.

🧩 **Part File Support**: Automatically detects and handles Dart's `part`/`part of` system - only exports main files, never part files.

## Usage

### Creating a Barrel File

1. **Right-click** on a folder in your Dart or Flutter project
2. Select **"Create Barrel"** from the context menu
3. Enter a name for your barrel file (e.g., `auth`, `models`) or press Enter to use the folder name
4. The barrel file(s) will be created automatically

The extension will:

- Scan the selected folder for `.dart` files
- Exclude `main.dart` and existing barrel files
- Generate barrel file(s) with all necessary exports:
  - **Non-recursive mode** (default): Single barrel file exporting only files in the current directory (subdirectories ignored)
  - **Recursive mode**: Hierarchical barrels in each subfolder + parent barrel that exports the subfolder barrels
- Open the barrel file for you to review

### Example

If you have the following structure:

```
lib/features/auth/
  ├── login_page.dart
  ├── signup_page.dart
  ├── widgets/
  │   ├── auth_button.dart
  │   └── auth_form.dart
  └── models/
      └── user.dart
```

### Non-Recursive Mode (default)

Right-click on `auth/` → "Create Barrel" → Press Enter (or type `auth`):

```dart
export 'login_page.dart';
export 'signup_page.dart';
```

This creates a single barrel file (`auth.dart`) that exports **only the Dart files in the current directory** - subdirectories are ignored.

> **💡 Tip:** Just press Enter to automatically use the folder name (`auth`) as the barrel filename!

### Recursive Mode (when enabled in settings)

With `barrelMe.recursive: true`, right-click on `auth/` → "Create Barrel" → Press Enter:

This creates **hierarchical barrel files**:

**`auth/models/models.dart`:**

```dart
export 'user.dart';
```

**`auth/widgets/widgets.dart`:**

```dart
export 'auth_button.dart';
export 'auth_form.dart';
```

**`auth/auth.dart`:**

```dart
export 'login_page.dart';
export 'models/models.dart';
export 'signup_page.dart';
export 'widgets/widgets.dart';
```

This hierarchical approach:

- ✅ Creates a barrel file in each subfolder (only if it has 2+ main files)
- ✅ Parent barrel exports subfolder barrels (not individual files)
- ✅ Better organization for large codebases
- ✅ Each module can be imported independently
- ✅ **Smart conflict resolution**: If a file has the same name as its folder, the barrel is named `{folder}_barrel.dart`
- ✅ **Single-file optimization**: Subfolders with only one main file are exported directly (no barrel created)
- ✅ **Part file handling**: Automatically excludes part files - only main files are exported

### Smart Conflict Resolution

If a subfolder contains a file with the same name as the folder (e.g., `models/models.dart` with actual code), the extension automatically creates the barrel as `{folder}_barrel.dart` to prevent overwriting your code:

**Example:**

```
auth/models/
  ├── models.dart      (your actual code)
  └── user.dart
```

**Generated `auth/models/models_barrel.dart`:**

```dart
export 'models.dart';
export 'user.dart';
```

**Parent `auth/auth.dart`:**

```dart
export 'models/models_barrel.dart';
```

### Part File Support

The extension intelligently handles Dart's `part` and `part of` system. Part files are automatically excluded from barrel exports - only the main file is exported.

**Example:**

```
models/
  ├── user.dart           (main file with 'part' directives)
  ├── user.g.dart         (part file with 'part of user.dart')
  └── user.freezed.dart   (part file with 'part of user.dart')
```

**Generated `models/models.dart`:**

```dart
export 'user.dart';  // Only the main file, not the parts
```

**Optimization:** If a subfolder only has one main file (even with multiple part files), no barrel is created - the main file is exported directly in the parent barrel.

### Automatic Naming

When you press Enter without typing a name, the extension automatically converts the folder name to follow Dart naming conventions (snake_case):

| Folder Name     | Generated Barrel     |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `auth`          | `auth.dart`          |
| `AuthPages`     | `auth_pages.dart`    |
| `user-profile`  | `user_profile.dart`  |
| `shopping_cart` | `shopping_cart.dart` |

You can always override this by typing a custom name before pressing Enter.

## Configuration

You can customize the extension behavior in your VS Code settings:

### `barrelMe.exclude`

Folders to exclude when scanning for Dart files.

**Default:**

```json
["test", "generated"]
```

**Example:**

```json
"barrelMe.exclude": ["test", "generated", ".dart_tool", "build"]
```

### `barrelMe.recursive`

Enable hierarchical barrel file generation. When enabled:

- Creates a barrel file in each immediate subfolder
- Creates a parent barrel that exports the subfolder barrels
- Each subfolder's barrel exports files only within that subfolder

**Default:** `false`

**Example:**

```json
"barrelMe.recursive": true
```

### `barrelMe.excludeFiles`

Files to exclude from barrel exports.

**Default:**

```json
["main.dart"]
```

**Example:**

```json
"barrelMe.excludeFiles": ["main.dart", "app.dart"]
```

## Command Palette

You can also access the barrel creation command from the Command Palette:

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Create Barrel"
